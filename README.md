# README

After cloning the repository, you can run the application with the following commands in the cloned directory:

   bundle install
   
   rake db:create db:migrate
   
   rails server
   
Note I did not get around to adding a /help page even though a view for it exists.

You may log in with the credentials 0.govindparmar@gmail.com / ivrnet for either organization I created.
